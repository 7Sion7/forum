Development:

-Go is used for handling requests to the server, by adding the inputted data from the client-side to the SQLite database, and sending back the data needed to the front-end;

-JavaScript is used here mainly for the UI of the Web App through DOM, however, it also acts as a middleware between the client-side and the server (Go);

-HTML is used for UI and making requests to the server, and displaying responses, and CSS for designing the UI aiming to make it as user-friendly as possible.
